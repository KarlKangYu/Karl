Some males are so forcefully pursued by pushy females that they refuse the advances of previous partners.,1.0,1
"According to research published in the journal Current Biology, this helps males conserve their sperm for the possibility of mating with new females.",1.0,1

"All the main parties had changed leader, the UK had voted to remain in the Common Market in a referendum and had undergone a series of economic crises - leading to the nation's humiliating bailout by the International Monetary Fund in 1976 - as well as the now notorious Winter of Discontent of 1978-1979.",1.0,1

An election was now the inevitable result - in circumstances far from favourable for Labour.,1.0,1
Strikes over pay by unions such as the National Union of Public Employees as well as by gravediggers in Liverpool caused public outrage and terrible headlines - with The Sun now leading the charge for the Tories.,1.0,1
"The campaign itself was conducted mostly for television, with Margaret Thatcher proving skilled in managing photo-opportunities - although no agreement was reached on holding a televised debate between the party leaders, despite Callaghan's enthusiasm.",1.0,1

"The assertion is the latest bout in a long battle between the traditional bookmakers such as Ladbrokes and William Hill, and betting exchanges such as Betfair.",1.0,1
Betfair began in 2000 and is an internet site which matches two individuals with differing opinions on the outcome of any sporting event.,1.0,1

"The claims made by Chris Bell underline the main criticism of the traditional bookmakers, against Betfair.",1.0,1
Ladbrokes and William Hill say that the option of betting on a horse to lose with Betfair is opening the door to somebody benefiting if they know a horse won't win.,1.0,1
"But Betfair assert that far from corrupting racing, they are helping to prevent cheating by monitoring every account they have.",1.0,1

But the traditional bookmakers are fighting back with another argument.,1.0,1
The government will announce later this month whether it plans to target individual Betfair punters who bet on horses to lose - this would open the door to the option of their being taxed.,1.0,1
This development would have far reaching implications for the running of the Betfair business.,1.0,1
"But behind the PR war, splashed across the headlines of every newspaper in the country, experts argue that it is not the concerns over corruption, but rather the squeeze on the traditional bookmakers' margins which is the real reason for the battle.",1.0,1

"It has sought to address this, particularly with higher starting salaries.",1.0,1
The report also says there is flexibility for schools to give extra rewards to good teachers.,1.0,1
But it stresses that there needs to be enough money getting to schools to make these a reality.,1.0,1
"The review body says in its 90-page report that the issue of shortages was given further prominence after it had finished formally taking evidence, in submissions from the teaching unions.",1.0,1
"Other worries emerged in ""unsolicited letters"" from individual schools, and in media coverage.",1.0,1
That is why the review body has made particular recommendations on starting salaries for new entrants to teaching and on London allowances.,1.0,1
"These put the minimum starting salary at �17,001, with �20,001 in inner London and corresponding figures in the London fringe areas.",1.0,1
"The report points out that training salaries of �6,000 are now paid to people on postgraduate teacher training courses, with a further �4,000 ""golden hellos"" in secondary school shortage subjects.",1.0,1

"The review body says it has repeatedly drawn attention to criticism of the way schools are funded, via local education authorities, on the basis of a ""standard spending assessment"" - what the government thinks they ought to get.",1.0,1
"Traditionally many education authorities have spent more on schools than they were supposed to, ""often at the expense of other services"".",1.0,1
"But in recent years this ""overspend"" has gone down - and up to a third of authorities now do not spend even that basic level.",1.0,1
"""This has meant that the money actually reaching some schools has not increased to the full extent of the significant increases announced in central government funding,"" says the report.",1.0,1
"It calls for urgent action on government proposals to make the system more ""transparent"" and fair.",1.0,1
All this has an effect on the realities of what teachers earn.,1.0,1
"The report says schools now have ""considerable flexibility"" to award recruitment and retention allowances, ranging from �942 to �5,085.",1.0,1
But often schools say they have no budget for these.,1.0,1
"The review body says double salary increments can be awarded for excellent performance by teachers to accelerate their progress up the pay scale, so that after seven years or less most teachers will be earning a minimum of �24,843.",1.0,1

MoD press officers eventually confirmed Dr Kelly's name to journalists who suggested it.,1.0,1
Mrs Kelly described how on the evening of 8 July she and her husband had been at home watching a television news bulletin.,1.0,1
"On 9 July, Mrs Kelly said, the MoD press office phoned and told them to leave their home immediately because reporters were on their way.",1.0,1
Mrs Kelly said her husband had told her several times how betrayed he felt.,1.0,1

"Mrs Kelly replied, ""I believed he meant the MoD because they were the ones who had effectively let his name be known in the public domain.",1.0,1
Dr Kelly was then told by the MoD he would have to appear in public to give evidence to two committees - the Foreign Affairs Select Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee.,1.0,1
"Soon after the report was published, BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, the Director General Greg Dyke, and reporter Andrew Gilligan resigned.",1.0,1
"Lord Hutton absolved the government of any kind of ""dishonourable, underhand or duplicitous strategy"" in the leaking of Dr Kelly's name to the press.",1.0,1

Winter Olympics guide - Pairs' figure skating,1.0,1
Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier skated off the ice confident they had done enough to win gold after a seemingly flawless routine.,1.0,1
"Instead they watched in disbelief as the judges' marks placed them second behind Russian pair Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who had appeared to make some technical errors.",1.0,1
"In the ensuing furore, a French judge claimed she had been pressured into favouring the Russians, and it was eventually decided that the two pairs should share the gold medal.",1.0,1
The key to pairs skating is timing.,0.0,1
"The male and female skaters must mimic each other's movements as closely as possible as they execute a series of jumps, spins and step sequences.",1.0,1
"The other big difference between pairs and ice dancing is that in pairs the woman spends plenty of time in the air, with the man carrying out a series of lifts and throw spins.",1.0,1
"Performing to music, the two skaters have a time limit of two minutes and 50 seconds.",1.0,1
"The free skate technically has no required elements, but a well rounded routine that includes lifts, jumps, spins and sequences is essential to a good score.",1.0,1
The team chooses its own instrumental music and choreographs a programme that includes technical and artistic moves that best display both the individual strength and the ability to perform as a team.,1.0,1
The time limit for the free skate is four minutes and 30 seconds.,0.0,1
The marks from the two programmes are added together to obtain a final total.,1.0,1

"Under the new, more complicated system, there is now a technical score and a score for 'programme components'.",1.0,1
"As that happens, the nine judges - drawn randomly from a panel of 12 - each decide how well the element has been executed.",1.0,1
"This average is then added to the 'base value' to obtain a mark for each element, which goes towards the final score.",1.0,1
"Once competitors have begun their program, they are not allowed to restart it completely.",1.0,1

"All four bridges - Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro - span the East River, and connect the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to Manhattan.",1.0,1
"Mr Bloomberg's toll plans - which could raise up to $800m a year - have already angered the many commuters who cross these bridges daily, as well as officials from Queens and Brooklyn.",1.0,1
"As yet, it is unclear how much money the city would generate from the sale of the bridges, but Mr Bloomberg's spokesman Jordan Barowitz says the Metropolitan Transport Authority is a likely buyer.",1.0,1
The MTA already controls other toll-paid crossings to and from Manhattan.,1.0,1

"Mr Bush is expected to announce that he plans to reduce US troops in Iraq by about 30,000 by next summer, if certain conditions are met, White House officials say.",1.0,1

"He called on Senate Republicans to stop walking ""lockstep"" with the president over Iraq, saying the Democrats would offer alternatives when the Senate discusses a defence bill next week.",1.0,1
The Democrats have so far been unable to pass legislation to set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq because their majority in Congress is too slim to overturn a presidential veto.,1.0,1

"The H1N1 virus has been remarkably stable since it emerged in April, but virologists had been half expecting new resistant strains to emerge.",1.0,1

"The BBC's Panorama programme has uncovered documents which reveal the World Sugar Research Organisation and International Life Sciences Institute, both funded by the sugar industry, helped pay for the Expert Consultation on Carbohydrates in Human Nutrition.",1.0,1
"The programme also reveals that ISLI was given the opportunity to suggest members of the committee and select the chairman, as well as review the agenda of the consultation.",1.0,1
Since its publication the report of the consultation has been used by the sugar lobby to fight any suggestion of a link between sugar and health concerns.,1.0,1
"Now the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has said it plans to reconvene the research committee ""urgently"".",1.0,1
"The expert consultation was a joint venture between the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the FAO and was due to look impartially at key questions, including whether sugar is detrimental to human health.",1.0,1
But Jim Mann - a highly respected nutritionist from New Zealand - told the programme he always had doubts about the consultation's independence.,1.0,1
Another of the team invited to Rome sensed that the science might not be the only driving force.,1.0,1
Professor John Cummings claims that a chairman had already been chosen before the committee began its work.,1.0,1
He also claimed that one official - there as an observer - obstructed the debate when sugar was being discussed.,1.0,1
The experts didn't know that the sugar industry was paying for them to be in Rome.,1.0,1
But Panorama has discovered a series of documents which show exactly where the money came from.,1.0,1
"It shows that the World Sugar Research Organisation - funded by the sugar industry paid US$20,000 towards the consultation.",1.0,1
"ILSI - the International Life Sciences Institute - an American research group paid for by food companies like Coca Cola and Tate and Lyle also put in US$40,000.",1.0,1
Panorama reveals that ILSI was also invited to suggest who might sit on the consultation and even nominated the chairman months before the experts ever came to Rome.,1.0,1
"This funding deal was agreed with the FAO's then Director of Food and Nutrition, John Lupien.",1.0,1
"This news came as a surprise to the committee members that Panorama spoke to, none of whom had any idea that the research had been funded by the sugar industry.",1.0,1
But another shocking fact was to come out of the committee discussion.,1.0,1
Professor Mann complained that a report which failed to mention a limit on carbohydrate - or on sugar - was open to abuse.,1.0,1
"The FAO's Assistant Director General, Hartwig de Haen, was also surprised at Panorama's revelations.",1.0,1
"""If the funding was accepted together with influence of the choice of experts or of the wording of the report then it is unacceptable, that is true,"" he said.",1.0,1
A statement from the FAO confirmed that the ISLI and the WSRO were asked to propose names of experts for the consultation but that the FAO had the final say.,1.0,1
The FAO said the sugar lobby had misquoted and misinterpreted the recommendations of the 1998 study.,1.0,1
"It added that the WHO has been working on reconvening a Carbohydrates consultation, and that this matter was now ""regarded as urgent"".",1.0,1

But what allegedly happened behind the scenes at QPR's Loftus Road ground before the kick-off in their first game of the 2005/06 season sounded stranger still.,1.0,1
"Gianni Paladini, a 60-year-old former football agent whose client list had included top stars such as Fabrizio Ravanelli, Benito Carbone and Juninho, became involved with QPR in the summer of 2004.",1.0,1
"The club, based in west London, finished fifth in the inaugural season of the FA Premier League but they dropped out of the lucrative elite in 1996 and had struggled financially ever since.",1.0,1
"Also in 1996, music tycoon Chris Wright took over the club, but five years later he was forced to put the club into administration due to crippling debts.",1.0,1
"A year later the club got out of administration but only after securing a �10m loan from the ABC Corporation, who are based in Panama.",1.0,1
This was the background of financial desperation out of which Mr Paladini emerged.,1.0,1
"A promising teenage footballer, he had been forced to give up the game at the age of 18, before playing a single game for his home town club Napoli.",1.0,1
He became an interpreter in the football industry and eventually an agent,1.0,1
"Mr Paladini, who had come to Britain in the 1960s, lived in Solihull, just outside Birmingham with his wife, Olga, and children Stephen and Kate.",1.0,1
"In 2003 he had expressed an interest in taking over another cash-strapped club, Staffordshire-based Port Vale, but when that fell through he turned his attention to QPR and bought �600,000 worth of shares.",1.0,1
The trial at Blackfriars Crown Court heard that the QPR board was glad to meet someone who wanted to inject money into the club.,1.0,1
In fact Mr Paladini had remortgaged one of his homes and was far from the multi-millionaire saviour who supporters thought would rescue their club.,1.0,1
By August 2005 several people within the club had become hostile towards Mr Paladini and were suspicious about his plans for the club.,1.0,1
"On 13 August nearly 14,000 fans turned up to see QPR play Sheffield United.",1.0,1
"Mr Paladini arrived at the ground around 2pm with his son, daughter and grandson Gianluca, who was due to be the club's mascot that day.",1.0,1
"The trial heard he went upstairs to the chairman's suite and bumped into David Morris, the owner of a 2% share in the club, who asked to have a private word with him.",1.0,1
Mr Paladini claimed he was led into the chief executive's office and was surrounded by a group of thugs.,1.0,1
Mr Paladini's family alerted the police and armed officers arrived at half time and arrested Mr Morris and several other people.,1.0,1
"They questioned Mr Paladini who, at one point, broke away from the interview to go to the directors' box and celebrate a goal by QPR's Marc Bircham.",1.0,1
"Several men were eventually charged with conspiracy to commit blackmail, false imprisonment and possession of a firearm.",1.0,1
The prosecution claimed Andy Baker had been hired by Mr Morris to recruit a gang of hard men to intimidate Mr Paladini.,1.0,1
"But giving evidence at the trial, Mr Baker said he had been invited as a guest of Mr Morris's brother Dan and was hoping to tout for the club's lucrative stewarding contract, which was up for renewal.",1.0,1
"But while 13 August 2005 was the most dramatic day in the history of the soap opera which is QPR, the saga is not over.",1.0,1
"Mr Paladini, backed by several friends and fellow investors - including Brazilian World Cup winner Dunga and two Monaco-based companies - ousted chairman Bill Power shortly after the incident.",1.0,1
"In February this year the club's highly-rated manager Ian Holloway left after a series of rows with Mr Paladini, who had brought in players including Mauro Milanese, Marc Nygaard and Dean Sturridge.",1.0,1

Scientists have long believed that the Earth�s climate was stabilised by a natural carbon thermostat.,1.0,1
"In their model, carbon released into the atmosphere, primarily by volcanoes, is slowly removed through the weathering of mountains, washed downhill into oceans, and finally buried in deep sea sediments.",1.0,1
"""A lot of people had tried to refute this hypothesis, but our study provides the first direct evidence (that it is correct),"" said Dr Zeebe.",1.0,1
He studied levels of CO2 recorded in air bubbles trapped in a 3km ice core drilled from an Antarctic region called Dome Concordia (Dome C).,1.0,1
"Data from the ice core, drilled by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (Epica), was first published in 2005.",1.0,1
"But rather than focusing on the peaks and troughs of CO2 - as other researchers have done - this group looked at the long term trend, and compared the ice core data with records of carbonate saturation in the deep sea for the last six glacial cycles.",1.0,1
"""It is remarkable how exact the balance is between the carbon input from volcanoes and the output from rock weathering,"" said Dr Zeebe.",1.0,1

The researchers looked at 24 people with the disorder.,1.0,1
"One had bought more than 2,000 wrenches, another owned 55 cameras.",1.0,1
All had been compulsive shoppers for at least a decade and had suffered financially or personally because of their disorders.,1.0,1
Each patient was given citalopram for seven weeks.,0.0,1
"Two thirds reported they were much improved, or very much improved.",1.0,1
Five of the eight who took the dummy pill reported relapses.,1.0,1
All seven who continued taking the medication reported they had experienced a loss of interest in shopping.,1.0,1
"They had ceased browsing for items on the internet or television shopping channels, and reported the ability to shop normally without making impulsive purchases.",1.0,1
"The researchers from Stanford University Medical Center, California, were led by Dr Lorrin Koran, who said he was amazed by the rapid improvements which had been seen.",1.0,1
Further research is to be carried out by the team.,1.0,1
"Dr Robert Lefever, director of the Promis recovery centre in Kent, told BBC News Online it was wrong to use drugs to treat compulsive shopping, because it was simply replacing one addition with another.",1.0,1

"They have signed an open letter, timed to coincide with a government-hosted dementia research summit in London.",1.0,1
"The experts have urged the government in England to end ""years of underfunding"" for research into the debilitating disease.",1.0,1
But ministers said they were already investing strongly in research.,1.0,1
"The London summit will bring together scientists, doctors, carers and people with dementia.",1.0,1
"It will set out to identify where support is needed most, and to help ensure that dementia research gets its fair share of funding.",1.0,1
"Seven hundred thousand people in the UK now live with dementia, and the figure is going up fast.",1.0,1
"It is estimated that the cost of treating and caring for people with dementia is £17bn a year - more than the cost of heart disease, stroke and cancer combined.",1.0,1
"However, research into cancer received far more government funding.",1.0,1
"Professor Nick Fox, from University College London, said the support for cancer research has shown what might be achieved with dementia.",1.0,1

"""We are able to capitalise on new technologies and look at every single gene in the human genome in thousands of people.",1.0,1

He said the number of trials needs to increase tenfold to speed up the rate of discovery.,1.0,1
"""Research doesn't turn new treatments round in five minutes.",1.0,1
"Researchers are clearly excited about the summit, but also concerned it could simply turn out to be a talking shop.",1.0,1
"Professor John Hardy, a scientific adviser to the Alzheimer's research trust said hopes had been raised before.",1.0,1
"""I'm concerned that what will happen is that they will come up with the idea that they should have a focus group of some description to come up with a plan that will take a year or 18 months to report.",1.0,1

The two sides in Sri Lanka are already having a war - they just haven't told anybody yet.,1.0,1
"And they've decided, so far, not to have the war everyone was expecting.",1.0,1
"The Norwegian mediators, the EU, the Japanese and even an Indian holy man have all been busy trying to persuade both sides not to return to an all-out conflict.",1.0,1
"But apart from the hardliners, neither the government nor the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), as the rebels are known, seem to want a big war because neither side is really prepared for it yet.",1.0,1
The reasons are cash and Karuna.,0.0,1
"Colonel Karuna was one of the Tamil Tigers' heroes of the last war, which ended with the much talked-about ceasefire agreement signed four years ago.",1.0,1
"Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan, Col Karuna's real name, is both partly the cause of the present crisis and why there probably won't be a full-scale war anytime soon.",1.0,1
He split from the Tigers because he said the eastern cadres were not being properly represented in the group's hierarchy.,1.0,1
Some analysts in Colombo say it was more to do with an alleged financial investigation by the Tigers into his family's business interests in the region.,1.0,1
"Whatever the truth is, Col Karuna has levelled the playing field.",1.0,1
He has opened up an eastern flank and has provoked the Tigers by attacking and destabilising them with the kind of guerrilla tactics the LTTE have used so successfully against the government over the years.,1.0,1
For the first time if a proper war happened both sides would now be facing a conventional force on the battlefield and a guerrilla force spreading terror in the areas populated by their civilians.,1.0,1
So the Tigers want him stopped.,1.0,1
The government committed itself to disarming any paramilitaries operating in areas under their control.,1.0,1
But they've avoided taking action by saying Karuna is moving in Tiger territory beyond their influence.,1.0,1
"The fact is, though, that whilst the more moderate wings of the government say he is an out-of-control menace who is doing more harm than good, the military leadership couldn't be happier.",1.0,1
"They have absolutely no intention of trying to disarm Karuna even if they could, which the UN said recently was doubtful.",1.0,1
"And some analysts say that, while the military isn't arming Karuna, they are supporting him with finances, logistics and medical assistance for his injured fighters.",1.0,1
The worry in all of this is that the government in Colombo might overplay its hand.,0.0,1
The hardliners in the leadership believe a short sharp war could bulldoze the Tigers into submission and force a negotiated settlement.,1.0,1
President Mahinda Rajapakse has so far managed to fend off the more extreme suggestions from the right-wingers within his government.,1.0,1
And he allowed limited air strikes to take away their puff after the latest Tiger suicide attack in the capital.,1.0,1
"But his attempts to stop a wider war are being undermined by the LTTE, something the international community is recognising.",1.0,1
"Thursday's attack by the Tigers on the navy left the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission fuming, particularly as it took place whilst their people were on the government boats.",1.0,1
And there is increasingly a weariness creeping across the face of diplomats trying to resolve this conflict.,1.0,1
"Nobody likes being treated as a fool, and when the Tigers tell mediators they have no idea who sent a suicide bomber to blow up the army chief, finger nails start pushing into palms.",1.0,1
But even with all the provocation President Rajapakse knows war is not an option because the country simply cannot afford one.,1.0,1
"The economy is too shaky, damaged by years of war, the tsunami and then by the upsurge in violence.",1.0,1
"As a colleague in Colombo pointed out, all it would take is a bomb in a hotel and one at the port to decimate two of the country's biggest foreign exchange earners.",1.0,1
Those investors lured back to Sri Lanka last time at the prospect of peace might pack their bags for good.,1.0,1
The Tigers would also see their foreign income strangled.,1.0,1
"Canada and the UK, where the group is banned but most of the Tamil diaspora lives, would probably make serious efforts to stop the willing and unwilling donations given to the Tiger fundraisers.",1.0,1
That's now much easier to do post 9/11 and the changes to the international banking regulations.,1.0,1
Another attack by the Tigers on someone as strategically important as the army chief might push the country beyond the point of no return.,1.0,1
"In the meantime, the government will sort out security in the capital after places like its army headquarters turned out to have worse security than a Western shopping mall.",1.0,1
"The Tigers will use their time to try and finish off Karuna, with the army doing its best to see that that fight drags on draining resources and energy from both groups.",1.0,1
Attacks like the one on the navy and claymore mine blasts against the army will rumble on.,1.0,1
"And so will the revenge killings against civilian Tiger sympathisers by the nasty bands of death squads, a few of whom appear to be linked to rogue bits of the security forces.",1.0,1
"In short, people will carry on dying on a daily basis but in small enough numbers to maintain the fa�ade that the ceasefire agreement is holding.",1.0,1

Mr Hain used to be known as one of the more Eurosceptic Labour MPs but soon became one of the government's most enthusiastic promoters of the prospect of British entry into the European single currency.,1.0,1
He is seen as trusted by Mr Blair to sometimes say things the prime minister cannot - and his tax proposals will be seen in that light.,1.0,1
It is inconceivable that his speech was not approved by Mr Blair.,1.0,1
"In the debate over the euro, Mr Hain has been vocal in backing the currency - and was again seen as reflecting the views of Downing Street.",1.0,1
"He replaced Paul Murphy as Secretary of State for Wales in October 2002 - although since the post-devolution role is not the most demanding in the cabinet, he also retained his place on the Convention on the Future of Europe.",1.0,1

It pointed to the fact that by launching a war against the Serbs in February 1998 they had in effect managed to subcontract Nato to eject Serbian rule from the province.,1.0,1
Mr Thaci's party pointed out that Mr Rugova's period as undisputed leader of the Kosovo Albanians from 1989 to 1998 and his policy of passive resistance to the Serbs had failed.,1.0,1

"After almost a decade of repression, 16 months of war including expulsion or flight for many, and now 17 months of relative lawlessness since the end of the conflict, the vote for Rugova is a vote not just for independence since, in effect, all votes were for independence, but it is above all a vote for normality.",1.0,1

The Halifax announced the drive to drum up its mortgage business as it reported its financial results to the London Stock Exchange.,1.0,1
This was at the upper end of market expectations.,1.0,1
"In the overall market, though, the Halifax continues to hold about 19% of all mortgages, a leftover from its days as a building society, when it could offer more competitive mortgage rates.",1.0,1
The bank hopes that it can come out on top in the mortgage wars once it begins selling the new deals in March.,1.0,1
"However, the new rate tracking the Bank of England's base rate will be guaranteed only until the end of this year.",1.0,1

The calcium-charged vegetable still needs to go through many safety trials.,1.0,1
"""These carrots were grown in carefully monitored and controlled environments,"" said Professor Kendal Hirschi, part of the team at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.",1.0,1
But the scientists nonetheless hope their carrot could ultimately offer a healthier way of consuming sufficient quantities of the mineral.,1.0,1
Dairy foods are the primary dietary source of calcium but some are allergic to these while others are told to avoid consuming too much due to their high fat content.,1.0,1
A gene has been altered in the carrot which allows the calcium within it to cross more easily over the plant membranes.,1.0,1
"On its own, the carrot would not meet the daily requirement of 1,000mg of calcium, but if other vegetables were similarly engineered, intake could be increased dramatically.",1.0,1

But General Musharraf has said that he now plans to leave the laws completely unchanged.,1.0,1
"Minority religious groups in Pakistan, and especially the Christians, have long complained that the blasphemy laws are used to persecute them.",1.0,1
The human rights commission said that the military regime's stated commitment to human rights had been exposed as hollow.,1.0,1
It said General Musharraf had made a craven retreat after being panicked by conservative clerics.,1.0,1
"Currently, if an individual goes to the police and simply accuses someone of blasphemy, the police have to make an immediate arrest before an investigation.",1.0,1
"General Musharraf was suggesting that to discourage false accusations, claims about blasphemy should initially be referred to a senior civil servant, who would then investigate before ordering any arrest.",1.0,1
"The military insisted that this was just a procedural change, and did not mean that the law itself was being amended.",1.0,1
"Nevertheless, many Islamic groups reacted sharply and their threats of protests this Friday have led General Musharraf to change his mind.",1.0,1
The Christian Liberation Front said that the military authorities had bowed to extremist pressure.,1.0,1
"It had proved incapable of pushing through a relatively minor measure which anyway fell well short of a full repeal of the blasphemy laws, it said.",1.0,1

"Horst Koehler passed the law, but warned it might contravene human rights clauses by allowing passengers to be ""sacrificed"" to protect others.",1.0,1

Interior Minister Otto Schily dismissed Mr Koehler's doubts and said he was wrong to publicly question the law.,1.0,1
President Koehler said he had signed the law into effect because it contained other measures vital to air safety - such as tighter air-traffic controls and more powers for pilots to restrain disruptive passengers.,1.0,1

"Swedish star Helen Alfredsson criticised the guidance Wie gets from her parents, who manage her.",1.0,1
"Wie's loss of form meant she was not granted an exemption for Sunningdale, although she did have a chance of getting in at an LPGA Tour event in Illinois two weeks ago.",1.0,1

Wie then made a late decision to opt against entering the final qualifying tournament for the British Open.,1.0,1

Newcastle survived a nervous final 10 minutes to win in front of their biggest home crowd for 27 years.,1.0,1
The Magpies had looked set for an easy win when goals from new-boys Carl Cort and Daniel Cordone as well as substitute Stephen Glass gave them a 3-1 lead early in the second-half.,1.0,1

"Young midfielder Seth Johnson pulled a late goal back to add to Derby's earlier one from Branko Strupar, but Newcastle managed to hold on.",1.0,1
Newcastle started the game as if they had a point to prove following their demolition by Manchester United on Sunday.,1.0,1
"They drove forward, with the recalled duo of Kieron Dyer and Nolberto Solano particularly threatening.",1.0,1
After five minutes the increasingly inevitable Newcastle goal arrived.,1.0,1
"Solano made a good run down the right, cut inside and delivered an accurate cross to Cort, who rose at the far post to place an excellent header past Mart Poom in the Derby goal.",1.0,1
Newcastle continued to look the more threatening side and Alan Shearer was calling for a penalty after 15 minutes when Bjorn Otto Bragstad appeared to hold him back inside the box.,1.0,1
"Bragstad was then involved at the other end, heading powerfully but straight into Shay Given's arms from a corner.",1.0,1
Cort's memorable evening was cut disappointingly short when he was forced off after half-an-hour following an early knock and replaced by Stephen Glass.,1.0,1
Stefano Eranio shimmied to beat Barton and lifted the ball narrowly over the Newcastle cross bar before Deon Burton got between Nikolaos Dabizas and Aaron Hughes in the box but scuffed his shot straight at grateful Given.,1.0,1
But in first-half injury time Derby got the reward that their resurgence deserved.,1.0,1
"Higginbotham lifted the ball to Strupar from the right and the Belgian got a fortuitous rebound off Hughes, but he made the best of his luck and coolly slotted the ball past Given.",1.0,1
Stephen Glass crossed into the box and the ball was weakly cleared by Powell straight at Cordone.,1.0,1
The Argentinian fooled Powell by shaping to shoot and then struck the ball into the far corner of the net.,1.0,1
Glass made it 3-1 by curling a sumptuous shot past Poom from more than 20 yards out.,1.0,1
This heralded a period of complete dominance by Newcastle when the Rams struggled to get out of their own half.,1.0,1
But the home fans had a nervous final 10 minutes after Barton was dismissed.,1.0,1
The Newcastle defender dwelt on the ball and was dispossessed by Burton.,1.0,1

"""The way we use the oceans is that we hope and assume there will always be another species to exploit after we've completely gone through the last one,"" said research leader Boris Worm, from Dalhousie University in Canada.",1.0,1
"This is a vast piece of research, incorporating scientists from many institutions in Europe and the Americas, and drawing on four distinctly different kinds of data.",1.0,1
"In 2003, 29% of open sea fisheries were in a state of collapse, defined as a decline to less than 10% of their original yield.",1.0,1
"Bigger vessels, better nets, and new technology for spotting fish are not bringing the world's fleets bigger returns - in fact, the global catch fell by 13% between 1994 and 2003.",1.0,1
"Historical records from coastal zones in North America, Europe and Australia also show declining yields, in step with declining species diversity; these are yields not just of fish, but of other kinds of seafood too.",0.0,1
"Zones of biodiversity loss also tended to see more beach closures, more blooms of potentially harmful algae, and more coastal flooding.",1.0,1
The final part of the jigsaw is data from areas where fishing has been banned or heavily restricted.,1.0,1
"These show that protection brings back biodiversity within the zone, and restores populations of fish just outside.",1.0,1
"""The image I use to explain why biodiversity is so important is that marine life is a bit like a house of cards,"" said Dr Worm.",1.0,1
"""All parts of it are integral to the structure; if you remove parts, particularly at the bottom, it's detrimental to everything on top and threatens the whole structure.",1.0,1
"What the study does not do is attribute damage to individual activities such as over-fishing, pollution or habitat loss; instead it paints a picture of the cumulative harm done across the board.",1.0,1
"Even so, a key implication of the research is that more of the oceans should be protected.",1.0,1
"But the extent of protection is not the only issue, according to Carl Gustaf Lundin, head of the global marine programme at IUCN, the World Conservation Union.",1.0,1
"""The benefits of marine-protected areas are quite clear in a few cases; there's no doubt that protecting areas leads to a lot more fish and larger fish, and less vulnerability,"" he said.",1.0,1
"But, he said, the concept of protecting fish stocks by protecting biodiversity does make sense.",1.0,1
"Protecting stocks demands the political will to act on scientific advice - something which Boris Worm finds lacking in Europe, where politicians have ignored recommendations to halt the iconic North Sea cod fishery year after year.",1.0,1
"Without a ban, scientists fear the North Sea stocks could follow the Grand Banks cod of eastern Canada into apparently terminal decline.",1.0,1

"State-owned Gazprom, one of the world's largest gas companies, has been on an acquisition spree over the past two years.",1.0,1

"The Russian government has also been accused of using the energy giant as a foreign policy tool, with Gazprom cutting gas supplies to Ukraine last winter, and threatening to do the same to Georgia this time around.",1.0,1

"For another the ""content board"" of the new regulator, Ofcom, with its remit to protect the public interest in things like programme quality and diversity, might put them off - by and large US companies don't like regulation, and Ofcom, many of whose staff are likely to come from old-fashioned regulators like the Independent Television Commission, the Radio Authority and the Broadcasting Standards Commission, might look pretty heavy-handed to them.",1.0,1
"The rule preventing any company with more than 20 per cent of national newspaper ownership from controlling ITV has clearly been drawn up to exclude Rupert Murdoch, the biggest newspaper proprietor, who also controls BSkyB.",1.0,1

His advice to Ms Lane Fox is to build on best practice.,1.0,1

Out-of-hours drinking and any informal company business conducted in the pub could become the first casualty because of certain religions that do not permit the drinking of alcohol.,1.0,1
It is anticipated that companies with a strong drink culture could be vulnerable to claims from employees who feel they have been passed over for promotion because of their non-involvement in these social activities.,1.0,1
The proposed measures were enshrined in draft legislation and consultation papers published last week.,1.0,1
The first and most immediate change will be introduced in December 2003.,1.0,1
This will make it illegal to discriminate against individuals on the grounds of their religion or belief or sexual persuasion.,1.0,1

"While this could lead to a more tolerant society, she says, it may breed resentment among some workers.",1.0,1
One concern she has is that religion and belief have not been defined under the proposals - and she envisages lengthy battles that could go as far as the European court.,1.0,1

Rwanda and Uganda were singled out for criticism.,1.0,1

"For the first time, farmers would get a single subsidy payment for looking after their land rather than the amount of food they produced.",1.0,1
What followed was government mismanagement of such a scale it's pushed some farmers to the brink of financial ruin and could cost the taxpayer millions of pounds.,1.0,1
The change to the way farmers are paid is part of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.,1.0,1
The amount farmers receive largely depends on the amount of land they own.,1.0,1

"Arthur Hill, who runs an arable and livestock farm in Shropshire, was owed more than �70,000 as of June 2006 and intends to take the government to court over the fiasco.",1.0,1
The impact has been felt across the wider rural community with farm suppliers and many other businesses suffering because farmers have been unable to pay them.,1.0,1
"So what had happened? Because the new system depends on how much land people own, people who hadn't previously received subsidies such as vegetable growers and pony paddock owners were able to apply.",1.0,1
The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) which was set up by the government to see farmers got their money was overwhelmed with applications.,1.0,1
"Around 120,000 forms were received, 40,000 more than had been predicted.",1.0,1
The forms themselves were detailed and what farmers thought they owned often didn't tally with what the RPA had on its records.,1.0,1
The multi-million pound computer system which the agency had installed to process the applications simply couldn't cope.,1.0,1
Nowhere else in Europe has there been failure to pay on the level of that in England.,1.0,1
"Across the borders in Scotland and Wales for example, a simpler system based on how much farmers had been paid in previous years has been employed.",1.0,1

"In 2004, it was ranked 120 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.",1.0,1
"Bizarrely, this era-defining funk track was not the first single to be released from the Thriller album - an honour which went instead to the saccharine Paul McCartney duet The Girl Is Mine.",1.0,1
"The song is recognisable from the very first thud of the kick drum, something that was very much intended - producer Quincy Jones told his audio engineer to create a drum sound no-one had ever heard before.",1.0,1
"Jackson's writing is a masterclass in musical economy - the entire track comprising little more than a dirty, fuzztone bassline, that drumbeat and the star's staccato, almost mournful delivery.",1.0,1
But before then Michael Jackson would break a few more musical boundaries.,1.0,1
"Twenty-six years later, the influence of Jackson's melting pot approach can be heard in the rap-rock crossovers of Linkin Park and the heavy, crunching guitars used by pop acts like Katy Perry.",1.0,1
"Considered to be one of Jackson's signature songs, Thriller was in fact written by British musician Rod Temperton.",1.0,1
"Although the song is best remembered for its music video, it is also one of Jackson's most sonically inventive tracks - from the creepy B-movie sound effects to Vincent Price's spooky graveside rap.",1.0,1

"Described by Jackson's record company as ""a rock 'n' roll dance song about racial harmony"", Black Or White was one of the biggest radio hits of the 1990s.",1.0,1
"This was no mean feat in an increasingly formatted radio market, and was a tribute to the star's ability to combine musical genres - in this case hard rock, dance, pop and rap.",1.0,1
"The lyrics are perhaps less thought-provoking than Jackson intended - ""if you're thinking of being my baby it don't matter if you're black or white"" is hardly up there with Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" - but they gave Jackson another opportunity to poke fun at critics' comments about his skin tone.",1.0,1
"His willingness to appropriate hip-hop beats also put him ahead of many of his contemporaries, who were increasingly left behind by the likes of Public Enemy and NWA.",1.0,1
Jackson's last UK hit to really cross over to the mainstream was a Christmas number one in 1995.,1.0,1
"Written as a protest against environmental destruction, the song's simple, wordless hook is a plaintive howl of despair - with none of the promise of redemption Jackson saw in Man In The Mirror.",1.0,1

"Dr Eric Altschuler, from the University of California, in San Diego, claims that instead of being a hero, Samson was actually mentally ill.",1.0,1
"In a report in the New Scientist, Dr Altschuler said that in today's society Samson would be seen as ""a bit of a thug"".",1.0,1
He said he had gone back to his Bible and started to re-appraise Samson in a totally new light.,1.0,1
"""When I used to go to Sunday school I thought he was good and led the battles.",0.0,1
"Dr Altschuler said Samson routinely got into fights, killed 1,000 Philistines single-handedly and then gloated over it and showed no remorse.",1.0,1
"He also showed a reckless regard for his own safety when he told Delilah, a woman who had already tried to kill him three times, the secret of his strength.",1.0,1
All these Dr Altschuler said point to Samson having an anti-social personality disorder (ASPD).,1.0,1
"People diagnosed with ASPD exhibit at least three of seven specific behavioural traits such as being impulsive, reckless and habitually getting into fights.",1.0,1
"Dr Altschuler said the Biblical tale clearly shows Samson was suffering mental health problems from an early age, setting things on fire, torturing animals, stealing and bullying other children.",1.0,1
"And problems seem to have run through Samson's family, a whole chapter in the Bible is devoted to Samson's mother being warned by angels not to drink.",1.0,1
Dr Altschuler says this shows she too was reckless and had a disregard for others.,1.0,1
"Kevin Gibson, a consultant clinical psychologist and head of adult psychology at Sunderland Hospitals Trust, said society would view Samson in a different light today.",1.0,1
"""Today we would see his ruthlessness and exploitiveness as having a personality disorder,"" he said.",1.0,1

He added that the level for loss of earnings was set after Miss Martin argued that she had difficulty in getting similar employment to her work at Lake House rather than in hotels and restaurants.,1.0,1

"The French were out of the blocks more smartly, but it was the Scots who passed up a terrific opportunity to score the first try.",1.0,1
Dan Parks passed to Jason White when he might have gone directly for the line.,1.0,1
"Then with three men on the overlap, White elected to hold onto the ball and he was brought down short of the line by Dimitri Szarzewski and the chance was lost.",1.0,1
The Scots continued to belie their pre-match tag as underdogs with some exhilarating rugby and Paterson was able to add a penalty from the French 10-metre line as the visitors' unforced errors count mounted.,1.0,1
"Mike Blair and Paterson combined to great effect to mount another breakaway - the latter being halted by an early tackle, which led to another penalty, again successfully converted by Paterson.",1.0,1
"Michalak underlined the frustration of the French with a poor drop-goal attempt, but they did get on the scoreboard just before half-time courtesy of a Jean-Baptiste Elissalde penalty, after Bruce Douglas was penalised.",1.0,1
Paterson added the two points with his most difficult kick of the day.,1.0,1
"Paterson then missed a straightforward kick in front of the posts, and almost immediately afterwards Elissalde reduced the deficit with a kick of his own.",1.0,1
"But far from capitulating as the French applied more concerted pressure, Scotland held firm, forcing their opponents into more mistakes.",1.0,1
"As full-time approached, though, France pinned the Scots back and their patience paid off when Bruno powered over, only for Elissalde to miss the conversion and Scotland saw out the final minutes.",1.0,1
"It says the measures are being considered because problems caused by alcohol and drug abuse in the workplace - including accidents, absenteeism and poor performance - are on the increase.",1.0,1

Israeli scientists are working on a revolutionary idea to make computers smaller by using DNA strands to 'grow' the circuitry.,1.0,1
The research could signal the beginning of a takeover of the electronics industry by biotechnology.,1.0,1
"At present, silicon chip manufacturers are unable to make the chips significantly smaller by using current methods.",1.0,1

"Scientists have reconstructed a chunk of DNA from the genome of a Neanderthal man who lived 38,000 years ago.",1.0,1
The genetic information they extracted from a thigh bone has allowed them to identify more than a million building blocks of Neanderthal DNA so far.,1.0,1
Details of the efforts appear in the journals Nature and Science.,1.0,1
"""The sequence data will serve as a DNA time machine,"" said co-author Edward Rubin, from the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, California, US.",1.0,1
"Studying the Neanderthal genome will shed light on the genetic changes that made our species what it is, after the evolutionary lineages of Neanderthals and modern humans diverged from one another.",1.0,1
"It could also reveal what colour hair, eyes and skin Neanderthals had, whether they were capable of modern speech, shed light on aspects of their brain function and determine whether they contributed to the modern human gene pool.",1.0,1
"While mtDNA has confirmed that Neanderthals were indeed different from us, the information gleaned from it is limited.",1.0,1
"Researchers used cutting-edge DNA sequencing techniques to retrieve genetic material from the Neanderthal femur found in the Vindija Cave, Croatia.",1.0,1
"Writing in Nature journal, Professor Svante Paabo and colleagues describe how they recovered more than one million base-pairs - the building blocks of DNA - by directly reading the genetic sequence.",1.0,1
"This method resulted in the recovery of 65,250 base-pairs of Neanderthal DNA.",1.0,1
Professor Paabo told BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh that he planned to look at the form of the gene FOXP2 in Neanderthals; this gene is implicated in the development of language skills and has undergone evolution in modern humans since our divergence from chimpanzees.,1.0,1
"""We have two little snippets of genes involved in skin and hair colour, but they don't give any hint of a special variant that would be of interest,"" Paabo told the BBC News website.",1.0,1

"The question of whether modern humans and Neanderthals mated when they encountered each other 40,000 years ago is highly controversial.",1.0,1
One US scientist recently suggested modern humans might have acquired a variant of the brain gene microcephalin through interbreeding with Neanderthals.,1.0,1
"Edward Rubin's team found no evidence for a Neanderthal contribution to the modern gene pool, but Professor Paabo's analysis hints at a possible contribution in the other direction - from modern humans into Neanderthals.",1.0,1
The researchers say more extensive sequencing is needed to address this possibility.,1.0,1
"Professor Chris Stringer, from London's Natural History Museum, said the results ""confirm the distinctiveness of the Neanderthals, and support previous estimates of the divergence time.",1.0,1

"Even if he did, it seems that voters simply wouldn't care - or would see his intervention as a case of people, glasshouses and stones.",1.0,1
The absence of the corruption card from the campaign appears to be borne of a general cynicism about French politicians.,1.0,1
"The French have a word for it - ""magouilleurs"" or schemers.",1.0,1

Mayor Chirac had used huge cash bundles to pay for travel for himself and his entourage - he insisted it was for reasons of security rather than money-laundering.,1.0,1
But nothing has stuck to the Teflon president.,1.0,1
"Even when the main judge investigating some of the claims against him, Eric Halphen, resigned in disgust earlier this year, Mr Chirac appeared to suffer no electoral damage.",1.0,1
"Neither did the return to France of a key corruption suspect, Didier Schuller, after years in Caribbean exile, make any difference.",1.0,1

"Yet he has always courted controversy - whether receiving a six-month ban for pulling jockey Stuart Webster off his horse, battling with tabloid newspapers or being accused of having an affair with the wife of his then trainer Sir Henry Cecil.",1.0,1
Fallon and Cecil ended their racing partnership in 1999 as a result of the allegations but the Irishman denies any wrong-doing.,1.0,1

"And he went on to dismiss out of hand European criticism of Russian force as ""disproportionate"".",1.0,1
"He added that Russian tanks had, after all, only been 15km from Tbilisi and could easily have taken the Georgian capital and ousted President Mikhail Saakashvilli if they had wanted to.",1.0,1
Mr Putin also accused the US of behaving like the Roman Empire by believing it could pursue its own interests and extending its influence to the Caucasus without regard for Russia's point of view.,1.0,1
"""God forbid that we should tread on US toes in its backyard,"" he said, expressing frustration that the United States seemed to think it was all right to arm Georgia on Russia's border - a move which he repeatedly argued had provoked Georgia to take up military action.",1.0,1

The protein triggers the release of the parasite from red blood cells enabling it to invade neighbouring cells.,1.0,1
"Blocking the protein stops the parasite in its tracks and could lead to the development of new anti-malaria drugs, a study in Cell suggests.",1.0,1
Malaria causes around three million deaths worldwide each year.,1.0,1
The team at the National Institute for Medical Research have been working on the protein - an enzyme called PfSUB1 - for a decade but they did not know until now it was involved in helping malaria propagate inside the body.,1.0,1
"The Plasmodium falciparum parasite that causes malaria multiplies inside red blood cells until the daughter parasites, known as merozoites, are ready to infect other cells.",1.0,1
It was found that merozoites contain a set of previously unrecognised components called exonemes that are packed full of the PfSUB1 enzyme.,1.0,1
The enzyme is able to destroy existing cell structures allowing the parasite to escape the red blood cell and go on to infect other cells.,1.0,1
"By scanning thousands of compounds, the researchers found a plant-derived molecule that was able to block the PfSUB1 enzyme preventing the merozoites from escaping.",1.0,1
"In some developing countries, malaria is a huge problem, causing millions of deaths, but there is increasing resistance to existing treatments.",1.0,1
"Dr Mike Blackman, an expert in parasitology said the research had identified a ""druggable"" target as the team had shown that it was possible to block the enzyme in question.",1.0,1

"""There is widespread resistance to anti-malaria drugs and that's a real issue in many parts of the world.",1.0,1

The rarely seen Risso's dolphin was photographed off Mounts Bay in Cornwall in June of this year.,1.0,1
Scientists have now identified it as the same dolphin once seen 172 nautical miles away off Bardsey Island in Wales.,1.0,1
The new sighting will help conservationists better understand the offshore habits of this enigmatic and strange-looking creature.,1.0,1
But the dolphins' preference for deep offshore waters means they are rarely seen.,1.0,1
"""This is a fortuitous, unique and very interesting discovery,"" says Mark Simmonds, international director of science at the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS).",1.0,1
"Compared to other dolphin species, scientists know relatively little about the structure and size of the Risso's dolphin population living around the UK.",1.0,1
Knowledge of their movements and appearances in different locations is therefore vital to understanding their biology.,1.0,1
"According to the WDCS, more research needs to be done on the species, and measures taken to protect places which Risso's dolphins frequent, such as Cardigan Bay in Wales.",1.0,1
"The water around Bardsey Island in Cardigan Bay is an important marine habitat for various cetacean species including bottlenose dolphins, harbour porpoises and Risso's dolphins.",1.0,1

"However, the Spaniard had been in such a position in last year's final.",1.0,1
"Having reached the semi-finals in his two previous visits, Ferrero was widely tipped to overcome compatriot Albert Costa in the final.",1.0,1

"Honeybees getting ready to swarm, at 100 minutes the high pitched ""piping-signal"" is audible above the background buzz.",1.0,1
"By buzzing a ""piping"" signal the bees are able to initiate an explosive departure from the hive.",1.0,1
Bees are known to use signals to tell the colony when to swarm but which bees had the power to make this decision was unclear.,1.0,1
Now scientists have identified a small oligarchy of individual bees that hold the key to swarm behaviour.,1.0,1
The researchers reveal their findings in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.,1.0,1
This causes a swarm as the honeybees travel to form a new colony in a new location.,1.0,1
The sudden departure of bees has been known about for centuries and bee keepers have even found ways to avoid it happening and avoid loosing valuable bees.,1.0,1
But scientists have only recently begun to understand how the bees coordinate their departure and mass exodus.,1.0,1
"""In this study we wanted to determine what bees are responsible for organising this mass departure, and how they organise this process in an efficient manner,"" says Dr Juliana Rangel from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, US.",1.0,1
Dr Rangel undertook the study along with Sean Griffin and Professor Thomas Seeley also from Cornell University.,1.0,1
"""Our study is the first one to reveal the identity of the signallers that initiate a swarm's departure from the hive,"" Dr Rangel says.",1.0,1
"The report finds that a small group of experienced forager bees called nest-site scouts produce a ""piping-signal"" that primes the workers for swarming.",1.0,1
This makes the bees warm up their flight muscles for departure.,1.0,1
"They then produce a ""buzz-run"" signal which releases the departure of the swarm.",1.0,1
This small oligarchy of bees make up only 5% of the colony's total population.,1.0,1
"The researchers think that the oligarchy in the colony they studied consisted of only 200 individuals in colony size of 8,000.",1.0,1
It is the job of these bees to go out of the hive and search for potential homes for the colony.,1.0,1
This is a dance-like movement by which the bee communicates the distance and direction of a location to other bees.,0.0,1
"""Before our studies little was known about how this sudden exodus was coordinated, and which bees were in charge of this process,"" Dr Rangel says.",1.0,1
Animals that travel in groups must synchronise the timing of their movements.,1.0,1
Three different decision making mechanisms are known to coordinate a group's departure Dr Rangel explains.,1.0,1
"Right in the middle lies an oligarchy where a small number of well-informed individuals, makes the decision of when the group should move.",1.0,1
"""Decisions of group travel made by an oligarchy are very rare, and very few studies have reported an oligarchic control of group travel,"" says Dr Rangel.",1.0,1

Bath were thankful for the precise kicking of Jon Preston as they saw off Castres in their first game of the Heineken Cup.,1.0,1
The former All Black kicked dix penalties and a conversion to ensure that the hosts saw off a late rally from their opponents.,1.0,1
"Chief coach Jon Callard's decision to reinstate Preston, albeit at fly-half rather than scrum-half, was entirely justified.",1.0,1
Preston was dominant in other areas to give the Bath back line a much more positive look than of late.,1.0,1
"After ex-Lion fly-half Gregor Townsend opened the scoring with a penalty on three minutes for the visitors, Preston prised open the Castres defence by putting Phil de Glanville through a gap.",1.0,1
Although the try did not materialise Castres were caught offside and the New Zealander levelled the scores.,1.0,1
Two more penalties gave Bath the initiative before Preston worked a loop with de Granville and sent Matt Perry clear on the outside.,1.0,1
Number eight Dan Lyle was perfectly placed on the England full-back's shoulder to score under the post.,1.0,1
Penalties apiece for Townsend and Preston left Bath ahead at the break before Preston added another nine minutes into the second half.,1.0,1

"Justice Minister Mucyo, during a recent trip to the United States, asked the United Nations' Security Council to transfer the tribunal to Rwanda.",1.0,1
One thing Ms Del Ponte has done is to try to weed out incompetence among tribunal staff.,1.0,1
She declined to renew the contracts of a group of staff membersearlier this year on the grounds they were incompetentand refused to waver when those fired accused her ofracial discrimination.,1.0,1
The tribunal hit the headlines again when it was discovered that genocide suspects were working alongside defence teams.,1.0,1
Other scandals have also dogged the tribunal - allegations that some detainees are running web sites and that others are wrongfully declaring themselves insolvent in order to benefit from defence counsel paid for by the taxpayer.,1.0,1
Another recent problem has been with the treatment ofwitnesses in court.,1.0,1
Survivors of Rwanda's genocide tend to find testifying a traumatic experience at the best of times.,1.0,1

"The report, produced by a team tasked with assessing the science of climate change, was intended to be the definitive summary of climatic shifts facing the world in the coming years.",1.0,1
The agency said that it would use stronger language to assess humanity's influence on climatic change than it had previously done.,1.0,1
"In 2001, it said that it was ""likely"" that human activities lay behind the trends observed at various parts of the planet; ""likely"" in IPCC terminology means between 66% and 90% probability.",1.0,1
"Now, the panel concluded that it was at least 90% certain that human emissions of greenhouse gases rather than natural variations are warming the planet's surface.",1.0,1
"On sea level, there has been a more fundamental debate.",1.0,1
"So the IPCC had to decide whether to exclude this from its calculations, or to estimate the effect of a process which scientists do not understand well but which could have a big impact.",1.0,1
"As for climate change influencing the intensity of tropical storms in some areas of the world, the IPCC concluded that it was likely - meaning a greater probability than 66% - that rising temperatures were a factor.",1.0,1
"""If you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system, the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light, because you can see what the costs of inaction are,"" he told delegates in Paris.",1.0,1
"Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep), said the findings marked a historical landmark in the debate about whether humans were affecting the state of the atmosphere.",1.0,1
He said that he hoped the IPCC report would galvanise national governments into action.,1.0,1
But a study published on the eve of the IPCC report suggested that the international body's previous reports may have actually been too conservative.,1.0,1
"Writing in the journal Science, an international group of scientists concluded that temperatures and sea levels had been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed in the last report, which was published in 2001.",1.0,1
The paper compared the 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change report with what has actually happened.,1.0,1

In total he hit 18 fours and two sixes in his 234-ball innings.,1.0,1
Laxman's century included 13 boundaries and saw him open up against Rashid in the 120th over to score the 15 runs Lancashire needed to secure maximum batting points.,1.0,1
"Both Loye and Laxman fell to Rashid, while Francois du Plessis could make only 18 before being caught by Joe Sayers at short cover off Ajmal Shahzad.",1.0,1
