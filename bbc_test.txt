"Some people tell me 'Mrs Zille you shouldn't dance, it's not your style'," she revealed on the campaign trail.
"Must I stand stiff and say 'no thanks, I don't want to dance?'," she said, adding that song and dance are part of South African culture.
Many say this is a day they thought they would never see.
Among the general's supporters there has been a sense of shock and anger.
Gen Pinochet's son, Augusto Pinochet Hiriart, said the arrest was a "transgression against international norms".
He addressed an angry crowd outside the British ambassador's residence in Santiago on Saturday.
Some of the 200-strong crowd threw eggs and stones at the building before moving on to protest at the Spanish embassy.
Several political parties have called emergency meetings to plan their response.
An amnesty law was passed in 1978 by Gen Pinochet which prevented any member of the armed forces- including its commander-in-chief - from being tried for human rights abuses.
He is currently facing 13 different charges in Chile ranging from state terrorism to genocide.
At a time when CD price wars and music downloads are putting entire High Street chains at risk, independent retailers Rough Trade are opening what they say is the country's biggest music-only specialist store.
If all goes according to plan, the 5,000 sq-ft Rough Trade East on Dray Walk, just off Brick Lane, will start trading on Friday, 20 July.
But just a few days before the scheduled opening, the only sight to quicken the pulse of music fans is the giant album covers that block out the shopfront, keeping prying eyes at bay.
Inside, actual records are nowhere to be seen, as construction workers run around trying to make an impression on a cavernous space that still betrays its industrial origins.
The new store represents a huge leap of faith for a company that forged its reputation in the white heat of the punk years.
The first Rough Trade shop opened in Notting Hill, west London, in 1976, and soon became known as one of the best places to find new wave music and fanzines.
A record label of the same name followed, but the two businesses went their separate ways in 1982 and are now run independently of each other.
Mr Godfroy was just three years old when the Rough Trade saga began, and has nothing in common with the "hippie co-operative" image that has always plagued the firm in the music business.
Despite the company's niche reputation, he feels it can fulfil what he sees as the "enormous demand" for a shop that offers expertise and can recommend music with authority - and he doesn't think downloads are killing the CD.
"With this store, we feel there's a dormant music shopper out there who's not buying music from the High Street simply because they don't like High Street retailers, not because they've gone off physical formats," he says.
Halfway across London, Rough Trade's second store, which opened 20 years ago in Covent Garden, is closing to make way for the new East End venture.
Staff are to be transferred from the old to the new premises.
He leafs through a copy of that day's Independent newspaper and finds yet another article about the death of the record shop.
A customer comes in and asks if Rough Trade's mail-order service will deliver to Colombia, where he now lives.
"We deliver pretty much everywhere," is the response, and an amiable chat ensues about the quality of record shops in Colombia.
Back in the East End, Mr Godfroy is impressed to hear about the exchange.
Rough Trade East is 10 times the size of the store it is replacing, and Mr Godfroy knows his more purist customers will be quick to seize on any sign that the firm has lost its integrity.
But the solution, as he puts it, is about maintaining what he calls the "counter culture" in the new, larger environment.
"Rough Trade Retail is all about the counter, the relationship we have with customers over the counter and the way customers then relate to us," he says.
"Customers recommend to us as much as we recommend to them and it's that symbiotic relationship that we have over the counter where they're not merely paypoints.
To that end, the new store will feature two long counters, across which Mr Godfroy hopes this kind of social interaction will take place.
Other features will include a state-of-the-art sound system, free wi-fi, a "snug" and a stage for bands to play live, as well as late opening hours and activities such as Saturday-morning badge-making workshops.
Their own language, once a proud international language of culture and science, the language of Goethe and Thomas Mann, Freud and Einstein, has had to live ever since the Third Reich with echoes of Nazi and then, in East Germany, communist distortion.
The echoes have not faded completely.
I walked around the new German Historical Museum in Berlin with historian Christoph Jahr, looking at the displays of Nazi propaganda.
On the one hand it all seems very distant from his generation's experience, he said.
"But as a historian I'm aware that we're all living in the shadow of the language of the Third Reich," he added.
Awkward echoes have also been evident as Germany comes to terms with its increasingly multiracial society.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described multiculturalism as a failure and the Berlin government wants a more thorough knowledge of German for all its citizens, to be a kind of glue to help hold society together.
But while some struggle to learn the language, others from immigrant backgrounds take the German they have learned in fascinating new directions.
And then there is pop music.
The writer and critic Karin Yesilada, daughter of a German mother and Turkish father, points to the huge rap scene in Germany, where young people often from immigrant backgrounds use the language as a "literary weapon", criticising their society very effectively.
"They look for the melody in German," she adds, "it's a kind of regaining German for art".
Lovers of classical German songs set to music by Schubert or Beethoven might find this hard to swallow.
But what is striking is the uninhibited way rappers use the language, just as writers from multiracial backgrounds tackle taboos from the Nazi past, and can also celebrate a time before the Third Reich when German was a common language across much of Europe.
German can never fully recover its old international role.
And some courses at German universities are now taught entirely in English.
But German is regaining a vigour and variety that was less evident in earlier post-war decades, and which communist East Germany could never enjoy.
It is becoming a more relaxed, self-confident language, flavoured with humour and musicality, yet still alert to echoes within living memory of brutal distortion.
